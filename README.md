# SimpleAST

SimpleAST is a Kotlin/Java library designed to parse text into Abstract Syntax Trees. It is heavily inspired by (and began as a port of) [Khan Academy's simple-markdown](https://github.com/Khan/simple-markdown).

It strives for extensibility and robustness. How text is parsed into nodes in a tree is determined by a set of rules, provided by the client. This makes detecting your own custom entities in text a breeze.
